				<h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-2"><span class="mr-2">2.2</span>Types of Information</h3>
				<p class="text-sm my-2">At the direction of Shoogloo Network, through Trackier collects the following
					types of information from users to help us optimize and measure our advertising network, affiliate,
					and publisher relationships:</p>
				<ul class="text-sm ml-6">
					<li class="my-2 list-disc">Ad Identifiers </li>
					<li class="my-2 list-disc">IP address</li>
					<li class="my-2 list-disc">Cookies</li>
					<li class="my-2 list-disc">Pixel Tags</li>
					<li class="my-2 list-disc">Imprecise Geographic Location Data derived from IP address and/or Wi-Fi
						networks.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-2"><span class="mr-2">2.3</span>Third-Party Sources</h3>
				<p class="text-sm my-2">Shoogloo Network can also view, and measure information provided by other
					third-party sources in the Trackier platform. Those sources may include Advertisers, Publishers,
					Affiliates, and other Networks and analytics partners. Affiliates may sign up with Advertisers
					through the Trackier platform or through their own client website. Affiliate information provided to
					our Advertisers will be used by Trackier for fraud prevention purposes and to fulfil contractual
					requirements with our Advertisers.</p>
				<h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-2"><span class="mr-2">2.4</span>Ownership of Data</h3>
				<p class="text-sm my-2">Shoogloo Network owns the data that is collected through the Trackier platform.
					Specific fields that likely contain personal data, such as IP address or device ID, maybe obfuscated
					or blanked, respectively, by the Trackier client.</p>
				<p class="text-sm my-2">Trackier shares the device information along with advertising id on installation
					for analytics and advertising purposes to understand how users interact with our app and to measure
					ad performance.</p>
				<h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-2"><span class="mr-2">2.5</span>Client-side Tracking</h3>
				<p class="text-sm my-2">Shoogloo Network uses Trackier for pixel or server post back tracking to collect
					information about users. Pixel tracking (also called “cookie-based tracking” and “client-side
					tracking”) methods store a Trackier session identifier in a user’s browser cookie on click. In post
					back tracking (also called “server-side tracking”), Trackier directly sends a session identifier to
					the advertiser on click. On conversion, the advertiser then communicates that identifier to Trackier
					for validation. Trackier also supports server-to-server measurement for some clients. With any of
					the mentioned methods, when an end-user clicks on an advertisement, goes to a specific web page or
					mobile app action that is being monitored, Trackier collects information from the user’s computer or
					device, including but not limited to IP and Ad Identifiers.</p>
				<h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-2"><span class="mr-2">2.6</span>Cookies</h3>
				<p class="text-sm my-2">User can disable cookies in most internet browsers. Disabling cookies will not,
					however, stop receipt of all advertisements. If an end-user would like to opt-out of a particular ad
					network, publisher, or advertiser’s ads, they will need to contact those companies directly to
					inquire whether they have an opt-out option. End users can also disable the collection of Ad
					Identifiers for targeted advertising by enabling the Limit Ad Tracking setting on their smartphone.
					End users can also reset the Ad Identifier altogether using their smartphone’s privacy settings.</p>
				<h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-2"><span class="mr-2">2.7</span>Tracking Technologies</h3>
				<p class="text-sm my-2">We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website or to manage
					our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to
					gather information about your activities on this site and other sites to provide you with
					advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. You may opt-out by visiting the website
					of that specific partner like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter and Quora.</p>
				<h3 class="text-base font-semibold mt-2"><span class="mr-2">2.8</span>Adherence to GDPR Policy</h3>

					subject rights, does not process sensitive personal data, and provides data processing agreements to
